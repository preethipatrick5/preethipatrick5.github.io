## About me

Hi, I am Preethi Patrick. My background is in Mathematics and Data Science. I have always been fascinated by numbers and I used to give mathematics lessons to my juniors when I was in school eventually undertook an undergraduate program in mathematics in the form of BSc Mathematics from the University of Kerala. During my course, I realized programming is a key aspect for any academician. The paper in python really intruiged me and I started teaching myself more. The curiosity eventually landed me on an MCA degree where I learnt much more than just python, but python really did stay with me. Apart from the fact that it was the first language I learned, python really made sense to me and I found it a breeze to use it. Along with my MCA I was also introduced to the domain of Data Science, which seemed like the perfect area for me to focus given my background in both Mathematics and Computer Science. I was pulled to the world of machine learning in particular as it seemed really interesting field even back then(considering the recent developments like ChatGPT I am glad I chose right ðŸ˜„). I have been exploring Data Science and Machine learning ever since and you can find some of the things I have done below.
