# Robustness of Deepfake Detection Model
Deepfake is a digitally edited, surrealistic video that shows an individual saying or doing something that isn't happening. 
Feeding their footage to a deep learning system and training them to exchange faces is part of the process. 
On the left of the Figure, a snapshot from the original interview with talk show Alison Brie, and on the right is a snapshot from a received deepfake showing Alison Brie's body and Jim Carrey's face. 
Deepfakes are hard to spot because they use authentic video and legitimate audio and aim to go viral on social media. 
As a result, many viewers believe the film they are watching is genuine.
