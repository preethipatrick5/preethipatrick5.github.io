# Robustness of Deepfake Detection Model

## What?

My disseration involved trying to understand the Robustness of various machine learning models that are used for Deepfake Detection. 
I chose this topic, out of the several, as it seemed challenging and was addressing a very important topic of conversation. 
Let me start by explaning what deepfakes are even though most people should have heard the term.

Deepfake is a digitally edited, surrealistic video that shows an individual saying or doing something that isn't happening. 
Feeding their footage to a deep learning system and training them to exchange faces is part of the process. 
On the left of the Figure, a snapshot from the original interview with talk show Alison Brie, and on the right is a snapshot from a received deepfake showing Alison Brie's body and Jim Carrey's face. 
Deepfakes are hard to spot because they use authentic video and legitimate audio and aim to go viral on social media. 
As a result, many viewers believe the film they are watching is genuine.

## How?

The how started with finding a dataset that can closely represent the latest updates in the deepfake domain.

I chose DFDC and FaceForensics++ as they were both the state of the art datasets available for deepfake related research.
